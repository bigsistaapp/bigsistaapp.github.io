      <h2>How the menstruation cycle works. </h2>
      <p>Your menstrual cycle is the body’s natural process that controls fertility. Ovulation usually
      occurs 14 days before your next period. This means that on the 14th day of your cycle your body
      will release an egg.</p>

      <!-- 21 DAY CYCLE -->
      <a name="21-day"></a>
      <h3>On a 21 day cycle</h3>
      <p>days 5, 6 and 7 are the days that you will be at your most fertile.</p>

      <!-- 28 DAY CYCLE -->
      <a name="28-day"></a>
      <h3>On a 28 day cycle</h3>
      <p>days 12, 13 and 14 are the days that you will be at your most fertile. (Remember that day one
      of your cycle is the first day of each period and the last day of your cycle is the day before
      your next period comes!.) If the egg is not fertilised, your uterus (womb) will start to contract
      to rid itself of the nest it made for the potential baby. This comes out as your period when the
      next cycle begins. If you have a 21 day cycle you will ovulate on the 7th day of your cycle. This
      means that on the 7th day of your cycle your body will release an egg that will come to rest in the
      fallopian tubes waiting to be fertilised.</p>

      <!-- 33 DAY CYCLE -->
      <a name="33-day"></a>
      <h3>The 33 day cycle</h3>
      <p>As mentioned, your menstrual cycle is the body’s natural process that controls fertility. Ovulation
        usually occurs 14 days before your next period.</br> So, if you have a 33 day cycle you will ovulate
        on the 19th day of your cycle.</br> This means that on the 19th day of your cycle your body will
        release an egg that will come to rest in the fallopian tubes waiting to be fertilised. On a 33 day
        cycle days 17, 18 and 19 are the days that you will be at your most fertile. (Remember that day one
        of your cycle is the first day of each period and the last day of your cycle is the day before your
        next period comes!)</p>

      <!-- RANDOM CYCLE -->
      <a name="No cycle"></a>
      <h3>I don’t have any of these cycles!</h3>
      <p> Not to worry, these are not the only cycles in existence. Many women do not experience regular
      menstruation cycles. If you are worried, visit your nearest clinic. When we start experiencing
      our menstruation cycles our bodies are not yet in a rhythm and it may take some time before your
      body adjusts to the big changes that happens during puberty. **Our bodies are not computers so
      your period may come a day before or a day after it is expected.</p>
