      <h2>WHAT IS MENSTRUATION?</h2>
      <p>Big Sista says menstruation is the process in a female of discharging blood
        and other material from the lining of the uterus at intervals of
        about one lunar month from puberty until the menopause, except
        during pregnancy.

      <h2>Hey girls listen up Big Sista says: </h2>
      <p>during menstruation, the lining of the uterus (womb) builds up and thickens. This is a place that will nourish
        the embryo if a pregnancy occurs. At the same time the lining of the womb is growing, an egg, or ovum,
        in one of the ovaries starts to mature.</p>
      <p>At about day 14 of an average 28-day cycle, the egg leaves the ovary. This is called ovulation.
        The egg travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus. Hormone levels rise and help prepare the
        uterine lining for pregnancy.</p>
      <p>A woman is most likely to fall pregnant during the 3 days before or on the day ovulaton. Did you know that:
        a gal becomes pregnant if the egg is fertilised by a man's sperm cell and attaches to the uterine wall. If not fertilised, it will break apart.
        Then, hormone levels drop, and the thickened lining of the uterus is shed during the menstrual period.
      </p>
